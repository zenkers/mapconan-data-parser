# mapconan data parser
This project was created to clean some data on an open source project I am contributing to <a href="https://github.com/Naksta/mapconan">mapconan</a>. In the project, markers are being created through hundreds of repetitive lines of js. I made this to extract the data from that js, and parse it into json. Once that's done we can use the json to either setup and api, or at least just have clean data we can loop through.
